  "summary": "The diff summary is too truncated (especially for ModelBuilder.tsx) to confirm implementation of the requested always-accessible mobile Tool Palette trigger and placement-mode indicator/cancel behavior. Some unrelated/meta files were modified and new global CSS utilities were added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Model Builder mobile layout so the Tool Palette access button remains visible and tappable while the user scrolls through the Narrative / Framework / Execution zones (e.g., sticky/floating trigger), without affecting desktop behavior, respecting safe-area insets, and still opening the existing Sheet palette.",
      "reason": "The provided ModelBuilder.tsx content is truncated and does not show any concrete UI/layout change (e.g., a sticky/floating SheetTrigger, mobile-only positioning, or safe-area padding usage) that guarantees the Tool Palette trigger remains visible while scrolling.",

        "frontend/src/components/ModelBuilder.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the always-accessible Tool Palette trigger indicates when placement mode is active, and provide an always-accessible way to cancel placement mode on mobile (clears selected tool).",
      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show any persistent placement-mode indicator on the trigger (badge/text) or a mobile-accessible cancel control wired to clear the selected tool.",

      "description": "Added global safe-area inset utility classes (.safe-area-bottom/top/left/right) in the global stylesheet.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest calls for keeping changes scoped to the Model Builder UI; adding global utilities in index.css is broader than necessary and not explicitly requested (even if it may support the safe-area AC).",
