      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When typing into the selected Options input, commas and spaces remain visible as typed (e.g., the user can type: \"New York, Los Angeles, London\" without characters being removed mid-entry).",
        "Multi-word options containing spaces are preserved as single options (e.g., \"New York\" is treated as one option, not split).",
        "Options are parsed by commas into the underlying options array (trimming leading/trailing whitespace around each option) at a time that does not interfere with typing (e.g., on blur and/or on save), so validation for select properties still correctly enforces at least one option."

Keep multi-word options intact by splitting only on commas; do not trim/strip mid-typing."
